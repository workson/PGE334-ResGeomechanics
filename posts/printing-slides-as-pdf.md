If you'd like to print out a PDF copy of the slides presented in class.  Navigate to the link for the slides and append the text `?print-pdf` to the end of the URL.  So


<http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE334-ResGeomechanics/slides/Lecture1.slides.html>


becomes


<http://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/PGE334-ResGeomechanics/slides/Lecture1.slides.html?print-pdf>


this changes the format of the slides to allow for better formatting of the PDF.  Then just go to the file menu in your browser and select `File -> Print` and print as PDF.

**Update:** The formatting should be a little better now.  Also, this may only work properly with the Google Chrome browser.
